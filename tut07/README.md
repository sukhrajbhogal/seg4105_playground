# Scrum Guide

The Daily Scrum, a fundamental practice within the Scrum framework of Agile software development, is a 15-minute time-boxed event that takes place every day during a Sprint. Its primary purpose is to enhance team collaboration and performance by allowing the Development Team to inspect their progress since the previous Daily Scrum and plan their work for the next 24 hours. This not only helps the team stay on track toward achieving the Sprint Goal, which is the overarching objective for the current Sprint, but also enables them to monitor how their work is progressing in terms of completing the items in the Sprint Backlog, a list of tasks they have committed to for the duration of the Sprint. While the structure of the Daily Scrum can vary and is set by the Development Team, it typically focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and may include questions like "What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?" or "What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?" 

After the Daily Scrum, the team or individual team members may engage in immediate discussions to address specific issues or adapt and replan the remaining work for the Sprint. The Scrum Master ensures that the Daily Scrum takes place, but it is the Development Team's responsibility to conduct the meeting and keep it within the 15-minute time-box. While others may be present, the Scrum Master safeguards the meeting from disruptions. The Daily Scrum offers various benefits, such as improved communication, reduced need for additional meetings, identification of impediments that need to be addressed, the promotion of quick decision-making, and an overall increase in the team's knowledge. It serves as a key inspect and adapt meeting, allowing the team to continuously improve and meet its goals effectively.


# Show Progress as a Developer

To deliver as a competent developer, it’s important to know how to show progress in a timely and concise manner that satisfies and answers your manager’s needs. 

The "hill" metaphor divides software development work into two distinct phases: the uphill phase and the downhill phase. The uphill phase is marked by uncertainty, problem-solving, and a lack of clear solutions, resembling the early stages of a project when the team is still figuring out the approach. In the context of a developer, the uphill phase consists of gathering requirements and establishing the tech stack your team will work with. It also cover’s initial doubts and discover the team will need to do in order to have a clear cut path to deliver the product or feature. 

In contrast, the downhill phase signifies certainty, confidence, and a clear path forward, mirroring the later stages of a project when the team has a well-defined plan and is executing it. In the context of a developer, the downhill phase consists of starting the development of the feature or product and ironing out the bugs as you go. It’s also important to make sure to check with the client as you develop to make sure there aren’t any misunderstandings and you’re delivering the right product or feature. The hill chart, which is a visual representation of this metaphor, allows software developers to convey the status of their work by placing scopes (representing different aspects of a project) at various points on the hill. Scopes located further up the hill indicate that the work is still in the problem-solving and uncertainty phase, while scopes closer to the top of the hill signify that the work is in the execution and certainty phase. This approach provides a powerful, at-a-glance view of project status that does not rely on explicit status meetings or numerical estimates.

One of the significant advantages of this approach is that it enables managers to assess project status without the need for frequent status meetings, reducing interruptions and awkward interactions between managers and development teams. With a self-serve system for updating and visualizing hill charts, managers can gain insights into how the work is progressing and whether there are any areas that might be stuck in the uphill phase. Furthermore, the hill chart encourages the team to address uncertainties and unresolved issues by prompting discussions about how to move the work from uphill to downhill. This approach also aids in sequencing work effectively by encouraging teams to tackle the most uncertain and critical tasks first, ensuring that surprises and roadblocks are addressed early in the project cycle. By using the hill chart, software developers can promote transparency, manage uncertainties, and prioritize work effectively, ultimately leading to more efficient and organized software development processes.
