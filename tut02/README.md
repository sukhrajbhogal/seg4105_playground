Chapter 2 - 5 Shape Up Summary

Chapter 2 - Principle of Shaping
Don't be too abstract (too vague) or too concrete (no creativity for designers, can take more time). Wireframes are too concrete, words too abstract. Good shaping should be rough and bounded.
An Example Singer gives is in addressing customer desire for calendar, but knowing calendars take long to build. The didn't want to build a calendar view 10% of users use, so they built a simplified grid view.
Shaping is closed door, mostly design work, interaction design. It's about:
What the feature does new.
How it works.
Where it fits an existing flows.
It helps in shaping to be  technically literate and know how hard implementation is. Shaping touches on strategic cost considerations, opportunity cost, customer. A shaper may have collaborator. Shapers move fast, speak frankly, and jump positions.
Steps:
Set boundaries.
Rough out the elements.
Address risks and rabbit holes.
Write the pitch.


Chapter 3 - Set Boundaries

Appetite is defined with these questions:
Is it worth a quick fix?
Is it a big idea worth a whole cycle?
Would we redesign what we already have to accommodate?
"Small batch" takes one designer and one to two programmers one to two weeks. "Big batch" is the whole six weeks for a same team. This is fixed time, variable scope. The appetite is not an estimate, it's a creative constraint on what we are going to make. You have to make trade-offs because with all time there's always a "better".
Respond to raw ideas with a default "someday". Don't put it on the backlog; wait and see if it's important.
For example: a customer asked Basecamp for more complex file permission roles. The team found someone on customer's team had accidentally archived the file, making it invisible. The team added a warning to the archive button reducing a six-week project to one day.
Beware grab bags like "redesign" or "refactor" or "files 2.0". These are too vague.

Chapter 4 - Find the Elements
"This isn’t a spec. It’s more like the boundaries and rules of a game. It could go in countless different ways once it’s time to play."
Questions we are trying to answer:
Where in the current system does new thing fit?
How do you get to it?
What are the key components or interactions?
Where does it take you?
Shaping involves "breadboarding", a concept that's borrowed from  electrical engineering. In EE, we're not worrying about the clock's case material just it's wiring.
Things we indicate in breadboarding:
places - things you can navigate to.
affordances - things a user can act on like buttons and Fields.
connection lines - how affordances take the user from place to place.
Another shaping technique is a "Fat Marker Sketch" – a sketch done with a big Sharpie so big you can barely write text with it.
With either technique you don't want to say to a designer or programmer: "I know I drew it this way, but ignore that." By that time it's too late, they've already taken it as a direction especially if you're above them in a hierarchy.

Chapter 5 - Risks and Rabbit Holes
We're looking for a very low probability of shipping before or after 6 weeks. Rabbit holes are technical unknowns, unsolved design problems, misunderstood interdependencies that make something take a multiple of the original appetite.
Questions when searching for rabbit holes:
Does this require new technical work we've never done before?
Are we making assumptions about how the parts fit together?
Are we assuming a design solution exists that we couldn't come up with ourselves?
Is there a hard decision we should settle in advance so it doesn't interrupt the team?
For one of Basecamp's projects, they had requests to do a grouping view for to-do lists. It's harder / riskier to do a group view for a to-do list; instead they left it as is and attached group labels to each item to show list groups. The workaround fit appetite. They compromised and they knew it.
Declaring something out of bounds is being upfront and explicit about what we're not doing. Everything is possible but nothing is free, so don't ask "is it possible" But "is it possible in six weeks?" then ask for ideas about risks.
Check in with technical experts. Present all the shaping work up until now then ask for feedback, and do it "conspiratorially". Say, "I'm not ready to present the pitch yet but wanted to get your take."
