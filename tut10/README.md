## Tutorial 10 - Retrospective

# What things did you do that think were awesome and should keep doing? 

As a developer on the product team, I successfully maintained consistent and clear communication with team members, ensuring everyone was informed about progress and challenges. My active participation in collaborative efforts, such as pair programming and knowledge sharing, significantly contributed to the team's efficiency. Additionally, my commitment to meeting sprint goals and adhering to timelines was noteworthy. These practices have positively impacted our productivity, and I believe continuing with them will contribute to ongoing success.

# What are things you think you should stop doing, and why?

While reflecting on the sprint, I recognize instances where I may have overcommitted to certain tasks or took on additional responsibilities that led to potential burnout. It's crucial to reassess and delegate tasks more effectively to prevent spreading myself too thin. Overcommitting can impact the quality of work and hinder overall productivity. By recognizing and mitigating these instances, I aim to prioritize tasks more efficiently, ensuring a sustainable workload and maintaining a high standard of output.

# What new things would you like to try out? 

I would like to explore the implementation of new tools or methodologies that could enhance our development process. For example, experimenting with different project management or collaboration tools might offer opportunities for improved efficiency and communication. Additionally, exploring new coding practices or integrating emerging technologies could elevate the quality of our deliverables. Embracing a mindset of continuous learning and experimentation will contribute to the team's growth and innovation.

# What are things that are affecting your team but are outside your scope of control?

Things that are affecting your group but aren't really in your control could be the workload from your other classes. If you have a lot of assignments, tests, or other things to do for other courses, it can make it harder to focus on your capstone project. Even if you try your best to manage your time, the workload from other classes can still slow down your progress on the project. Dealing with this might mean talking to your group members about it, finding ways to manage your time better, or even asking for help from your teachers to make things a bit easier.
