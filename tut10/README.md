## Plan you retrospective

# Pick the tool

To perform this retrospective, I'll be using a Miro board. 

# Pick the format

The format of this retrospective is called FLAT: Future direction, Lessons learned, Accomplishments and Thank you. 

## Articulate how your plan will make it engaging and meaningful

I'll hold a voting session at the end once everyone has added their thoughts to the board. This voting session will help solidify what needs to be focused on for the next sprint.
