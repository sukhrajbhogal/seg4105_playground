## Tutorial 3 - Writing a Pitch Summary

1. Definition of a Pitch: A pitch is a directional statement used when deciding to build a new feature or product. It's not a detailed specification but a suggestion or first draft of the idea. It includes the problem to be solved, some feedback from customers, and a suggested solution.
Pitch Components:
2. Problem: Clearly defines the problem the team is trying to solve.
Appetite: The scope or size of the solution, indicating how much effort should be spent on it.
Solution: Suggests a solution to the problem, often in the form of a directional document.
Rabbit Holes: Potential pitfalls or distractions that can consume a lot of time without significant progress.
No-Gos: Aspects that are explicitly out of scope for the project.
3. Anyone Can Pitch: While formalized pitches related to project work are typically written by a few designated individuals, anyone can pitch an idea. The formalized pitch is what determines the next steps in terms of project work.
4. Framing vs. Pitching: There is a distinction between framing a problem (defining the problem and business value without specifying the solution) and pitching a solution.
5. Team Autonomy: The team assigned to the work has the autonomy to figure out how to make the proposed solution happen within the given time and constraints. The pitch is not a detailed specification but a starting point.
6. Science Project: A term used for projects where success is uncertain, and the team is aware that it might not be feasible to deliver the intended outcome.
7. Tracer Bullets: Used as a metaphor for firing preliminary attempts to see if the solution is on target before committing to the full project.
8. Learning from Failure: Projects, especially science projects, may fail to produce the intended outcome, but the process provides valuable learning and feedback.

Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of autonomy, mastery, and purpose in shaping and executing projects, and the need to identify potential pitfalls early in the process. The goal is to provide a clear direction without overly specifying details and to allow the team to adapt and make informed decisions as the work progresses.
