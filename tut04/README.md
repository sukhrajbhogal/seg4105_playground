## Tutorial 4 - Betting Summary

# Chapter 7

In the advocated project management strategy, the avoidance of backlogs is emphasized as a means to alleviate the burden of accumulating tasks that often become irrelevant. Backlogs are deemed counterproductive, leading to wasted time on constant review and organization of old ideas, hindering progress on more immediate projects. Instead, the focus is on periodic betting meetings before each six-week cycle, where stakeholders decide on a select few potential projects without the need for a cumbersome backlog. This approach keeps meetings infrequent, short, and highly productive. If a pitch is chosen, it proceeds to the next cycle for implementation, and if not, it is discarded without the need for ongoing tracking.

The strategy promotes decentralized lists for tracking various elements like pitches, bugs, and requests, eliminating the need for a central backlog. This decentralization extends to different departments maintaining their lists independently. Regular one-on-one interactions between departments facilitate cross-pollination of ideas, allowing teams to advocate for what they find important. This decentralized and flexible system spreads the responsibility for prioritization and tracking, making it more manageable and adaptable. The approach values the freshness of conversations, bringing back ideas with context, relevance, and purpose. It emphasizes that truly important ideas will naturally resurface over time, discouraging the overvaluation of ideas and encouraging a dynamic, responsive approach to project planning.

The described project management approach revolves around six-week cycles, providing a standardized project size for efficient planning and execution. Two weeks of cool-down follow each cycle, allowing teams to reflect, plan, and work on individual projects. A betting table during the cool-down period involves high-level stakeholders deciding on upcoming projects, with options including new pitches from the past six weeks or revived older pitches. This streamlined decision-making process ensures swift and informed choices. The concept of "betting" sets expectations, requiring a specific payout, commitment to exclusive focus, and a cap on the downside. The approach enforces uninterrupted time during the cycle, preventing interruptions even for seemingly small tasks to maintain momentum. A circuit breaker mechanism ensures projects must be shipped within the allocated time, preventing runaway projects and motivating teams to reframe if needed. Strategic bug handling involves using cool-down periods, bringing significant bugs to the betting table, or scheduling dedicated bug smash cycles. The emphasis on a clean slate with each cycle and the ability to shape multi-cycle projects in defined segments enhances adaptability and responsiveness to changing priorities.

This approach combines a structured project management framework with flexibility, encouraging ownership, and responsibility within teams. The focus on strategic decision-making, pragmatic bug handling, and continuous learning contributes to an efficient and dynamic work environment. The cyclical nature of the process ensures adaptability to unforeseen changes while providing a clear structure for project planning and execution.

# Chapter 9

The project management approach described here tailors expectations and strategies based on whether a team is enhancing an existing product or developing a new one. For existing products, the conventional Shape Up process is followed, involving shaping the work, making a bet, and assigning it to a team for implementation within a six-week cycle. The existing code and design create a framework, and the process is likened to crafting furniture for an already-built house. In contrast, the development of new products involves distinct phases: R&D mode, production mode, and cleanup mode. During R&D mode, the product is in its infancy, and the focus is on experimentation and learning. The shaping is more fluid, with a focus on key components, the senior team takes on a hands-on role, and the goal is to spike ideas rather than ship a final product. In production mode, when the core architectural decisions are settled, multiple teams can contribute simultaneously, shaping becomes deliberate, and the goal shifts to shipping functional features. Cleanup mode precedes launch, allowing for final adjustments and bug fixes in a less structured, more collaborative environment.

The decision-making process at the betting table involves evaluating the significance of the problem, assessing the appetite for the solution's time commitment, and considering the attractiveness of the proposed solution. The timing of a project is also crucial, considering factors like recent project types and team morale. Additionally, ensuring the availability of the right people with the required expertise is part of the planning process. The approach allows flexibility and adaptation, ensuring that each project's unique characteristics are considered, and decisions are made collaboratively at the betting table. The emphasis is on separating problem and solution, maintaining a reasonable time frame, and adjusting strategies based on the evolving nature of the product development lifecycle.
