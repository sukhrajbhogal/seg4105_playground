From the perspective of a software developer, the realm of project management might be foreign to us. We may just see a PM as a scrum master or project owner, but the impact of project management is far more significant than a sprint planning meeting.

Project management, in the context of software, is in place for planning, resource allocation, scheduling, execution, tracking, and delivery of the project. However, project management in software development is different from the traditional project management in the sense that software projects have multiple iterations of testing, updating, and customer feedback.

Breaking down the most critical roles in project management gives is a deeper insight into the importance of this team when building quality software. At the top, the sponsor is at the head of the project. They have skin in the game so they have accountability in the project. They directly communicate to the highest level in the company such as stakeholders and executives. The project manager reports directly to the project sponsor. Their job is to plan, produce a schedule and build a team to get the project done. They identify the core problem and work with a team to devise a solution. The team leader is responsible driving the project and working with the team members to make sure all their needs are being met white also maintain continuous progress. They role is to translate the needs of the project to the team members while also translating the feedback and state of the team to the project manger. 

Although weâ€™ve only scratched the surface of the world of project management, its clearly evident that without this team, developers would be staring in the dark with no direction when it comes to making progress.
